# Getting started with Flamingo

## Development setup and first steps

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/)

2. Install `dep` via `go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep`.

3. Check out the flamingo hello world example into `$GOPATH/src/flamingo.me/example-helloworld`
(flamingo.me will be our [namespace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Organization)).
```bash
cd $GOPATH/src
mkdir flamingo.me
git clone git@gitlab.aoe.com:shared/i-love-flamingo/example-helloworld.git
```
Load the dependencies for this example project:

```bash
dep ensure -v
```

5. Your entrypoint is `main.go`, this is where the application is started.
   Run `go run main.go` to see a list of possible commands.
   Run `go run main.go serve` to start the server and open http://localhost:3322/
