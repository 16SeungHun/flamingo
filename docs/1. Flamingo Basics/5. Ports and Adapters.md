# Ports and Adapters

## binding and injection of Interfaces

A very common use case is to the binding of interfaces types. 
(e.g. for ports and adapters)


```

type (
  MyInterface interface {
   MyDefinedBehaviour()
  }
  
  MyFakeImplementation struct {}
  
  MyService struct {
    MyInterface  MyInterface `inject:""`
  }
)

var (
 //Check interface
 var _ MyInterface = &MyFakeImplementation{}
)

func (m *MyFakeImplementation) MyDefinedBehaviour() {}


```

Bind in your module the implementation of the interface that Dingo should inject:

```
injector.Bind((*MyInterface)(nil)).To(MyFakeImplementation{})
```
