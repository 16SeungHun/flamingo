# Coding Conventions

## Testing and Documenting Code

In go you place your tests directly in the package.
You can simply use the standard go testing tool.

To run tests of a certain package simply run the `go test` tool.
For example:

```
go test -v flamingo/core/cart/domain/
```

Also we want to provide a useful `go doc` api documentation. Therefore stick to the go doc conventions.

Conventions:

* go doc conventions: https://blog.golang.org/godoc-documenting-go-code
* Prefer to do "blackbox" tests and append "_test" to the package name in your testfiles
* Use `example_test.go` with Example* testfunctions where it is useful to show examples.
* Add a `doc.go` in case you want to provide a documentation for the package, and it doesn't fit anywhere else.

### Ginkgo

Some of Flamingo's package use [Gingko](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) for BDD based testing.
Take a look at the Dingo test suite to get an idea about the tests.

## Flamingo Module documentation

Each module should have a *Readme.md* file in its root:

* The first line should be a h1 headline with the Title of the module e.g. `# Cart Module`
    * This will show up in the rendered documentation as page title as well
* Any other headline should at least be h2 `## Subheadline` in order to show up in the generated table of content later.


## Flamingo Folder structure


```
flamingo     
│   
└───core (Core modules)
│   └───auth
│   │    └───Readme.md (module related documentation lives in the modules)
│   └───cms
│   └───product
│
└───framework (Framework modules live here)
│   └───router
│   └───web
│
│
└───doc ( additional documentation live here)
      └───2. Framework Modules (Contains Symlink to module Readme - in order to show them in overall documentation)
