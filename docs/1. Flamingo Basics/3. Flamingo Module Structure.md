# Flamingo Module Structure

## Module structure
Modules that contain business logic of some kind should:

* by itself be responsible for a clear concern / bounded context
* have as less as possible dependencies to other modules
* implement ports and adapters and therefore follow the naming and structure conventions.

For a quick reference:

```
moduleName
│   module.go (The entry for a Flamingo module)
│   README.md (The full documentation)
│
└───domain (technology free domain logic with secondary ports)      
│   
└───application (main modules use cases / programmers "API")
│
└───interfaces (interfaces to the outside)
│   └───controller (web and data controllers)
│   └───templatefunctions (templatefunctions)
│
└───infrastructure (implementation of secondary ports)
│   └───adapterExample.go (e.g. an adapter to an external microservice)

```

## Flamingo Module initialisation
Each Flamingo module should have a `module.go` in the root folder.

Here you typically:

* provide the Module Type with its `Configure` method as an entry to configure your module
* use Dingo (dependency injection) for Binding your types.
* register Routes and Handlers
* provide Default Configurations
* register Flamingo Commands, template functions and event listeners
