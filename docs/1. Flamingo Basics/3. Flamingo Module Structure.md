# Flamingo Module Structure

## Module structure
Modules that contain business logic of some kind should:

* By itself by responsible for a clear concern / bounded context
* Should have as less as possible dependencies to other modules
* Should implement ports and adapters and therefore follow the naming and structure conventions.

For a quick reference:

```
moduleName
│   module.go (The entry for a flamingo module)
│   README.md (The full documentation)
│
└───domain (technology free domain logic with secondary ports)      
│   
└───application (main modules use cases / programmers "API")
│
└───interfaces (interfaces to the outside)
│   └───controller (web and data controllers)
│   └───templatefunctions (templatefunctions)
│
└───infrastructure (implementation of secondary ports)
│   └───adapterExample.go (e.g. an adapter to an external microservice)

```

## Flamingo Module initialisation
Each Flamingo module should have a `module.go` in the root folder.

Here you typically do:

* Provide the Module Type with its `Configure` method as an entry to configure your module
* Use Dingo (dependency injection) for Binding your types.
* Register Routes and Handlers
* Provide Default Configurations
* Register Dingo Commands
* Register flamingo templatefunctions
* ...
