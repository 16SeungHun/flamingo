# Flamingo Bootstrap

## Configuration Context Areas

You can have several configuration areas in your project.

Configuration areas have:

* a name
* a list of modules to load
* a baseurl that will cause flamingo to "detect" and use that configuration area
* child config areas

With the concept of having childs, the config areas in your project can form a tree. Inside the tree most of the configurations and modules are inherited to the childrens.

This concept is mainly used to configure different websites/channels with different locales for example.
