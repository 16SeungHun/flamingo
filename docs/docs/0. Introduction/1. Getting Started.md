# Getting started with Flamingo

## Development Setup

* Install go :-) https://golang.org/


### How to start

Start with [Hello World Tutorial](2. Tutorial Hello World.md)

You can use DEV context by setting the environment variable "CONTEXT"

```
export CONTEXT="dev"
```


e.g.

```
CONTEXT="dev" go run akl.go server
```

This will load additional config yaml files - and you can use it to point to other service urls while developing.
