# Getting started with Flamingo

## Development setup and first steps

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/)

2. Check out flamingo into `$GOPATH/src/go.aoe.com/flamingo` (go.aoe.com/flamingo will be our [namespace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Organization)).
```sh
  git clone git@gitlab.aoe.com:project/om3/akl/flamingo.git $GOPATH/src/go.aoe.com/flamingo
```

3. Install `dep` via `go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep`.
Then download dependencies via `dep ensure`.
(Or `dep ensure -vendor-only` for fast and just the necessary dependencies).

4. Then run the frontend template build:
`cd akl/frontend && yarn && yarn build`

 You can also start the template dev mode by:
 `yarn dev`

5. Your entrypoint is `akl/akl.go`, this is where the application is started.
   Run `go run akl.go` to see a list of possible commands.
   Run `go run akl.go serve` to start the server

Please make sure to set your on-save setting to `go imports` in Gogland! (Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > Go > On Save)


### How to start

Start with [Hello World Tutorial](2.%20Tutorial%20Hello%20World.md)

---

You can use DEV context by setting the environment variable "CONTEXT"

e.g.

```
CONTEXT="dev" go run akl.go server
```

This will load additional config yaml files - and you can use it to point to other service urls while developing.
