# Run Tests

## 1) Run tests automatically
1. Open a terminal (e.g. in IntelliJ) and navigate to the "akl/integration-test" folder
2. run the `./integrationtest.sh` shell script to run all tests automatically 

## 2) Run a local test environment with docker
1. Open a terminal (e.g. in IntelliJ) and navigate to the "akl/integration-test" folder
2. run the `./integrationtest-dev.sh` shell script to run all tests automatically
3. Some docker-compose files will be executed. It could take a while to download the images and start the containers. Please be patient.
